# 🌱 Soil Moisture Dashboard (PWA)

A Progressive Web App (PWA) for **real-time soil moisture monitoring and pump control**.  
This app connects to an **MQTT broker** and displays moisture readings using a smooth color-gradient gauge (dry → wet).  
Users can also set pump runtime, manually switch the pump ON/OFF, and install this app like a native application on desktop or mobile.
